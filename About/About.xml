    <name>Post Office: The Letter Filter</name>

    <description>
Post Office introduces a dynamic letter filter system, allowing players to customize which in-game letters are dropped or displayed.

With Post Office, you can selectively drop letters based on their types, such as ThreatBig letters, ThreatSmall letters, NegativeEvent letters, and more.
This mod provides granular control over the types of letters you want to receive or ignore, giving you a more tailored gameplay experience.

The mod offers a user-friendly settings window where you can easily enable or disable various letter filters.

In the future, support for custom filters via regular expressions may be added (if I can be bothered).
