Post Office allows you to mute certain types of letters and messages. 

Why? Because I am playing with the "CAI 5000 - Advanced AI + Fog Of War" mod and those "Raid: <some faction>" or "Mechanoid cluster" incident letters kinda take some of the fun away of just having your colonists walk around a corner and be greeted by a bunch of angry tribals...

Have you always wanted to have mortar shells suddenly rain onto your base because you didn't notice you were being sieged? 
Or have raiders appear on your door step completely out of the blue? 
What about drop pods just suddenly crashing trough your roof into your storage area?

Welp, your wishes have been answered, I guess.
With Post Office, you can opt to globally disable certain letter types. For example, simply disable "ThreatBig" letters (the big red ones shown on the right) and all letters of that type (from all mods btw ^^) will be hidden.

Don't care about notifications that a new quest is available? Just disable "NewQuest" letters and you're good to go.

Why not simply use the "Silent Raids" mod? Because that one doesn't work for all mods (and because I struggled getting it to work with RimWar :P), soo yeah... now this mod exists ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In the future, support for custom filters via regular expressions may be added (if I can be bothered).

Requires Harmony to work.
